#summary documentation of vf7

= Introduction =

This is a very small application, but very useful for who has Thinkpad R & T versions, using Debian. 

In order to understand, what this application solves, is necessary to understand the problem.


= The problem =

Export the X output to an external monitor or projector.

In the basic configuration of Debian, with minimal packages, the Xorg configuration does not support a virtual screen to use with external devices.

The first thing to do is to re-configure the Xorg (At [xorg_setup] you can see the details of configuration).

Once Xorg is re-configured you need to run xrandr to send the X output as you want.
The xrandr sintax to export is something like this
{{{
 $ xrandr --output VGA --right-of LVDS --mode 1024x768
}}}
After the use of an external X outuput you will need to call xrandr again to revert the setup:
{{{
 $ xrandr --output LVDS --auto --output VGA --off 
}}}

However, write these commands every-time is boring. For this reason I've wrote this app to handle the problem.

Of course, the "common" solution is to handle the acpi events, with the "thinkpad special keys module" but I choose use an application as a solution for who does not want touch the kernel or acpi setup. Also it was a fun way to write something in C# using Mono.
